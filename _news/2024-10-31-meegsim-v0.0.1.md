Happy to share that we (<a href="https://www.alinastudenova.com/">Alina Studenova</a>, <a href="https://minajamshidi.github.io/">Mina Jamshidi Idaji</a> and I) prepared the first release of the **<a href="/projects/meegsim/">MEEGsim</a> toolbox**! It provides building blocks for simulating oscillatory activity and connectivity in M/EEG with a nice syntax on top. Feel free to check it out and <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.socials.email }}">get in touch</a> if you have any questions or feedback.
